peer dependencies in react version 17 are treated as error and warning in version 16 
while installing some packages from npm 

to resolve that we use : 
1)run command > npm config set legacy-peer-deps true
   and again install that package 
2)at installing that package use
   this command with --force, or --legacy-peer-deps
     eg. >npm install react-dates --force
